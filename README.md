# Reverse-Engineering-Authentication-App

Reverse Engineering Code!

I will be reverse engineering the starter code provided by my bootcamp and create a tutorial for the code and be adding instructions on how I could add changes to this project.

Following a developer looking at another person's code,

AS A developer

I WANT a walk-through of the codebase

SO THAT I can use it as a starting point for a new project

Following a business context. If i were to join a new team, I will likely be expected to inspect a lot of code that I have never seen before. Rather than having a team member explain every line, I will dissect the code by myself, saving any questions for a member of my team if i have any.

Rather then making a project demostrating my skills at coding. I want to demostate my ability to research and creativity in designing new ideas.
